    <h1 id="Top">There’s a lake in Africa that literally turns animals into stone-looking statues.</h1>


    <h3>Lake Natron in Tanzania is extremely salty and has a pH level between 9 and 10.5 — almost as high as ammonia.
        When birds and small animals fall into the lake, the minerals in the water calcify their bodies, coating them in
        a hard shell. They don’t actually turn to stone, but they become perfectly preserved, statue-like figures.</h3>

    <h4>reason this happens:
    </h4>
    <ul>        
        <li>he lake is fed by mineral-rich hot springs.</li>
        <li>Because it’s in a very hot climate, most of the water evaporates.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <ol>

        <li>So the lake becomes more and more concentrated with sodium carbonate and other minerals.</li>
    </ol>



    <p>Fun twist:The lake is deadly for most animals, but flamingos actually thrive there because their skin and legs
        can handle the extreme conditions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    A huge portion of the world’s flamingos hatch right next to a lake that would kill most creatures.

    So it’s basically:

    a terrifying death lake for most animals
    and a safe flamingo nursery at the same time.
