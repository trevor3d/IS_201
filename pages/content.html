    <h1>There’s a mushroom that makes ants act like zombies.</h1>

<h2>The fungus is called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, and it infects carpenter ants. Once inside, the fungus releases chemicals that take control of the ant’s nervous system, forcing it to behave in a very specific way that benefits the fungus.
</h2>
<h3>What happens is insane:</h3>
    <ol> The infected ant suddenly leaves its colony (ants never wander alone normally).

    It climbs up a plant to a very precise height — usually about 10 inches above the ground where temperature and humidity favor the fungus.

    It clamps its jaws onto a leaf or twig and becomes paralyzed.

    The fungus grows out of the ant’s body, eventually bursting through its head and spraying spores onto the ground below to infect more ants.</ol>
   

    It’s so precise that scientists call the final bite position “the death grip” — the ant becomes a living biological delivery system.

Even crazier:

    <ul>Some ant colonies have evolved “ant cemeteries” where they immediately remove any infected ant and dump it far away to protect the nest.

    There are even “ant social workers” dedicated to infection control.</ul>

Real-life zombie apocalypse, but for ants.
